## react-circular-progress

Circle-Progressbar based on [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) and [react-oberserve-size](https://github.com/oberonamsterdam/react-observe-size). Tweaked original component by adding few styling options including resizable property when placed inside a container.

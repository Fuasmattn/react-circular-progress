## react-circular-progress

Responsive Circular Progress inspired by [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) using [react-oberserve-size](https://github.com/oberonamsterdam/react-observe-size). Tweaked original component by adding few more styling options including resizable property when placed inside a container and inner text.

Use ```<NativeProgressCircle />``` to render the same Component without MUI framework.
